# My questions

1. The ERC-165 identifier for this interface is 0x80ac58cd, but how they calculated this? First list all function selectors in the interface, 2. compute the function (4 bytes) selector for each function 3. now take XOR(^) of all of them

2. does Transfer emits event for mint or burn? Yes, whenever the ownership changes, this event will emit.

3. during contract creation Transfer event? Not required

4. what happens to approve address after transfer? It should reset.

5. when calculating the selector id, why it doesn't contain the events? events aren't identified with 4 bytes they have 32 bytes.

6. what is the difference between safeTransferFrom and tranferFrom? after transfer is complete safeTrasferFrom checks is _to is smart_contract (code_size > 0). If yes, then it calls onERC721Received on _to and checks that return value should 
    bytes4(keccak256("onERC721Received(address,address,uint256,bytes)")).

7. can an operator call approve on behalf of the owner? Yes

8. when we emit Approve? we emit when calling to allow people to transfer on own behalf but but when we are reseting it unlike Tranfer event.

9. can a person have multiple operators? Yes allowed.

10. where should the tokenURI should point to json or Image url? to JSON schmea.

11. what functions ERC721 Enumearble adds? 1. totalSupply(), 2. tokenByIndex() returns the tokenId of NFT at that address, 3. tokenOfOwnerByIndex() returns the tokenID of NFT from there personal NFT list.

12. what makes NFT unique? (contract address, uint256 tokenId). this pair makes every NFT unique

13. why choose uint256 not any other data type? because UUIDs and sha3 hashes are directly convertible to uint256

14. does EIP721 interface includes mint and burning? No, why NO? 

# Auditing

1. it is possible that smartcontract checks for ERC721 interface but not for it's variations like ERC721 interface, can this create a problem?

2. Always check msg.sender in onERC721Received
    By default, anyone can call onERC721Received() with arbitrary parameters, fooling the contract into thinking it has received an NFT it doesnâ€™t have. If your contract uses onERC721Received(), you must check that msg.sender is the NFT contract you expect!

3. safeTransfer reentrancy
    SafeTransfer and _safeMint hand execution control over to an external contract. Be careful when using safeTransfer to send an NFT to an arbitrary address, the receiver can put any logic they like the onERC721Received() function, possibly leading to reentrancy. 

4. safeTransfer denial of service
    A malicious receiver can forcibly revert transactions by reverting inside onERC721Received() or by using a loop to consume all the gas.
