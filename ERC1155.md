1. why 1155 got created? for every new token they required to deploy new ERC20 same for every new collection

2. what is semi fungible tokens? tokens which can be fungible but can become non-fungible example event tickets which can be fungible before the event

    - setApprovalForAll
    - isApprovedForAll

5. if transfering to a contract what receivers we have to check? 
        - onERC1155Received
        - onERC1155BatchReceived

6. does the receiver should be called before or after the balance update? after, before can introduce reentrancy

7. how much is gas requiment of ERC165? 30000 gas

8. but for supportInterface function it is said that it should not consume more than 10000 gas.
